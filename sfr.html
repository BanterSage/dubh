                <h1>Second French Republic History</h1>
                <h2>How It Began (1848)</h2>
                <p>In February 1848, economic crisis, unemployment, and demands for political reform led to the <b>February Revolution</b> in Paris. King Louis-Philippe I abdicated and fled.</p>
                <p>France declared a republic once again, creating the <b>Second French Republic</b>.</p>

                <h2>Major Reforms</h2>
                <p>The new republic introduced several important changes:</p>
                <p><b>Unversal male suffrage</b> (all adult men could vote)</p>
                <p>Abolition of slavery in French colonies</p>
                <p>Freedom of the press and assembly</p>
                <p>Creationg of "National Workshops" to provide jobs for the unemployed</p>
                <p>However, the National Workshops were expensive and controversial. When they were shut down, it triggered the violent <b>June Days Uprising</b> in 1848, where workers revolted and were suppressed by the army.</p>
                <h2>Election of Louis-Napoleon</h2>
                <p>In December 1848, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte (nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte) was elected president by a huge majority. He was popular because of his famous name and promises of stability.</p>
                <p>But undert the constitution, presidents could only server one four-year term.</p>
