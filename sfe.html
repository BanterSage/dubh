                <h1>Second French Empire History</h1>
                <h2>How It Began (1852)</h2>
                <p>In 1851, President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte staged a coup d'état because he was not allowed to run for another term. In 1852, he declared himself <b>Emperor Napoleon III</b>, officially creating the Second French Empire.</p>
                <h2>Early Rule: Authoritarian Empire (1852-1860)</h2>
                <p>At first, Napoleon III ruled in an authoritarian way:</p>
                <p>Limited press freedom</p>
                <p>Controlled elections</p>
                <p>Strengthended police power</p>
                <p>However, he also focused heavily on modernization and economic growth.</p>
                <h3>Modernization of France</h3>
                <p>Massive rebuilding of Paris under Baron Haussmann</p>
                <p>Expansion of railways</p>
                <p>Growth of banks and industry</p>
                <p>Promotion of trade and capitalism</p>
                <p>France became more industrial and economically modern during this time.</p>
                <h2>Later Rule: Liberal Empire (1860-1870)</h2>
                <p>In the 1860s, Napoleon III began allowing:</p>
                <p>More press freedom</p>
                <p>Greater power to the legislature</p>
                <p>More political debate</p>
                <p>This shift was meant to gain public support, but it also made political opposition stronger.</p>
                <h2>Foreign Policy and Fall</h2>
                <p>Napoleon III tried to expand France's influence abroad. Some actions included:</p>
                <p>Supporting Italian unification</p>
                <p>Invtervention in Mexico (which failed)</p>
                <p>The biggest mistake came in 1870 when France went to war with Prussia in the <b>Franco-Prussian War</b>. France was quickly defeated, and Napoleon III was captured at the Battle of Sedan.</p>
                <p>In 1870, the empire collapsed and France declared the <b>Third Republic</b>.</p>
