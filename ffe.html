                <h1>First French Empire History</h1>
                <h2>How It Began (1804)</h2>
                <p>After rising to power during the French Revolution, Napoleon became First Consul in 1799. In 1804, he crowned himself <b>Emperor of the French</b>, officially creating the First French Empire</p>
                <p>Even though it was called an "empire," Napoleon kept some revolutionary reforms, like equality before the law and merit-based promotions.</p>
                <h2>Key Features of the Empire</h2>
                <h3>Military Expansion</h3>
                <p>Napoleon built one of the strongest armies in Europe and won major victories against Austria, Prussia, and Russia. At its height (around 1810-1812), the French Empire controlled or influenced much of Europe.</p>
                <p>Important campaigns included:</p>
                <p>The Napoleonic Wars (series of wars across Europe)</p>
                <p>The invasion of Russia in 1812 (a major turning point)</p>
                <h3>The Napoleonic Code</h3>
                <p>One of Napoleon's lasting achievements was the <b>Napoleonic Code</b>. Which:</p>
                <p>Established equality before the law</p>
                <p>Protected property rights</p>
                <p>Ended feudal privleges</p>
                <p>This legal system influenced many countries in Europe and Latin America, and remains the basis legal code for many countries on Earth.</p>
                <h2>Decline and Fall</h2>
                <p>The invasion of Russia in 1812 was disastrous due to harsh winder conditions and supply problems. After that, European powers united against France.</p>
                <p>In 1814, napoleon was forced to abdicate and was exiled to the island of Elba. He briefly returned to power in 1815 during the <b>Hundred Days</b>, but was finally defeated at the Battle of Waterloo by British and Prussian forces.</p>
                <p>He was then exiled to Saint Helena, where he died in 1821.</p>
