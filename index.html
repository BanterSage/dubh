                <h2> Welcome to the Political evolution of Modern France (1789-1940)</h2>
                <p>This website takes you through one of the most dramatic periods in European history, the transformation of France from absolute monarchy to its various forms of state after.</p>
                <p>Beginning with the chaos of the French Revolution, France abolished its centuries-old monarchy and created the <b>First French Republic</b>, experimenting with democracy during a time of war, political violence, and radical change.</p>
                <p>From there the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte led to the <b>First French Empire</b>, where France became the dominant military power in Europe before collapsing after years of war.</p>
                <p>We then explore the <b>Restored Kingdom of France</b>, when the monarchy returned but struggled to survive in a country forever changed by revolution. Political tension and social inequality sparked another uprising in 1848, creating the <b>Second French Republic</b>.</p>
                <p>From there the rise of Napoleon III brough the Second French Empire, a period of modernization, industrial grwoth, and urban transformation - ending in military defeat during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870.</p>
                <p>From that collapse emerged the <b>Third French Republic</b>, France's first long-lasting democratic regime. It strengthened parliamentary government, expanded public education, separated church and state, and led the country through World War I before ultimately falling during World War II in 1940.</p>
