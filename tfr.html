                <h1>Third French Republic History</h1>
                <h2>How It Began (1870)</h2>
                <p>In 1870, France was defeated by Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War. Emperor Napoleon III was captured at the Battle of Sedan.</p>
                <p>Soon after, the empire collapsed and France declared the <b>Third Republic</b> in September 1870.</p>
                <p>At first, many politicians expected the republic to be temporary, but it gradually became permanent.</p>
                <h2>Early Years and Challenges (1870s)</h2>
                <p>The new republic faced serious problems</p>
                <p>The loss of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany</p>
                <p>The violent uprising of the Paris Commune in 1871</p>
                <p>Political conflict between monarchists and republicans</p>
                <p>By 1875, constitutional laws were passed that officially established a parliamentary system with a president and two legislative chambers.</p>
                <h2>Republican Stability and Reform (1880s-1914)</h2>
                <p>Over time, the republic became more stable and strongly republican.</p>
                <p>Major developments included:</p>
                <p>Expansion of public education</p>
                <p>Separation of Church and State</p>
                <p>Growth of French colonial empire in Africa and Asia</p>
                <p>Strengthening of democratic institutions</p>
                <p>One major political crisis during this time wa the Drefus Affair, which deeply divided French soviety over issues of justive, antisemitism, and the power of the military.</p>
                <h2>World War I (1914-1918)</h2>
                <p>The Third Republic led France through World War I against Germany and its allies.</p>
                <p>Although France was victorious, the war caused:</p>
                <p>Massive casualties</p>
                <p>Economic strain</p>
                <p>Political tension</p>
                <p>The postwar period was marked by rebuilding and instability.</p>
                <h2>Decline and Fall (1930s-1940)</h2>
                <p>During the Great Depression, France experienced:</p>
                <p>Economic crisis</p>
                <p>Political divisions</p>
                <p>Weak coalition governments</p>
                <p>In 1940, Germany invaded and quickly defeated France during World War II. The government collapsed, ending the Third Republic and leading to the Vichy regime.</p>
